# Lantern

**Turning vanishing voices into letters for the future.**

Hackathon submission — Claude Hackathon 2026, theme _"Creative Flourishing"_ (inspired by Dario Amodei's _Machines of Loving Grace_).

## What it does

Paste a YouTube URL of a WW2 veteran's testimony. Lantern runs a 4-agent Claude pipeline that:

1. **Fetches** the transcript
2. **Excavates** structured story fragments (people, places, battles, emotions)
3. **Verifies** facts via web search, pulls period imagery
4. **Builds** a memory graph of entities
5. **Narrates** a historically-grounded, illustrated letter — written in the veteran's own voice, addressed to their future descendant

The 16 million Americans who served in WW2 are down to ~100,000. ~300 die every day. Their stories are on YouTube, in oral histories, in family archives — but they're not _reachable_ by the people who should hear them. Lantern turns a voice into an heirloom.

## Why it's more than a chatbot

- **4 coordinated Claude agents** (Story-Excavator, Fact-Weaver, Memory-Graph, Narrator)
- **Tool use**: hosted web search, structured fragment extraction, entity graph upserts
- **Extended thinking** on the Narrator — judges see the model _reason about the veteran's voice_
- **Parallel agent execution** (Fact-Weaver + Memory-Graph run concurrently)

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind 4
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (Sonnet 4.6 + Haiku 4.5)
- `youtube-transcript` for caption ingestion
- Server-Sent Events for live agent trace
- Deployed on Vercel
